<h1>Using LLVM Built From Source</h1>

<p>
Many features of the latest revision of c++ and tooling are not available on
stable compilers/stdlib's packaged in linux distributions (eg: debian/ubuntu).

For example, modules and &lt;print&gt; are only partially implemented at the time of writing.

This gates access to many such features for the curious developer.
</p>

<p>
It's useful to get access to the latest (possibly unstable) build of a compiler
to open up room for experimentation, both as a user and potential contributor.

I have a few ergonomic goals for a compiler install:
<ol>
  <li>findable/usable with minimal modification</li>
  <li>easy to build</li>
  <li>easy to replace</li>
  <li>easy to remove</li>
  <li>doesn't destroy my machine/default toolchain in some way</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The concrete linux distribution/kernel I am running is:
<pre>
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 23.10
Release:        23.10
Codename:       mantic
$ uname -r
6.5.0-15-generic
</pre>
</p>

<p>
LLVM in particular is a natural choice given these requirements:
<ol>
  <li>frequent improvements to extra tools such as clang-format, clang-tidy, clang-repl, ...</li>
  <li>separate compiler executables (clang++) avoid some conflict with default toolchain</li>
  <li>separate stdlib (libc++) avoids some conflicts with default toolchain</li>
  <li>easy to overwrite/remove without affecting system/package-manager packages (see below)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Install Location</h3>
<p>
The
<a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>
describes how different parts of the filesystem are managed in Unix operating
systems.

In practice, /usr/* directories are typically managed by your package
manager (eg: apt) and /usr/local/* contain artifacts relating to locally built packages.
</p>

<p>
On my machine, the $PATH environment variable (for executables) preferentially
takes binaries from /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin (this is a common default -- see bash(1)).
</p>

<p>
The same is true for libraries -- /usr/local/lib is preferred to /usr/lib in the default /etc/ld.so.conf on Ubuntu.

However, the actual search procedure is based on a cache of library locations
(to limit filesystem lookups during program startup).

Much confusion can be had (with opaque link/runtime errors) if the cache is
*not* updated. Fortunately, the cache can be reset by simply running
<pre>sudo ldconfig</pre>
after making changes to */lib directories. See ld.so(8) and ldconfig(8) for details.
</p>

<h2>Building LLVM</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html">Building LLVM with CMake</a>
page lists a number of options, which can take some time to grok.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Given the constraints above, I came up with the following build.sh script which
I run from my llvm root directory:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

cmake \
  -S llvm \
  -B build \
  -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;clang-tools-extra;lld;lldb" \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="compiler-rt;libc;libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind" \
  -DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=ON \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON \
  -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \
  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86

ninja -C build            # can limit to clang,runtimes,... as desired
sudo ninja -C install     # be sure to only run with sudo if deps are prebuilt,
                          # otherwise build/ will have files owned by root
</pre>

A couple remarks:
<ol>
  <li><code>RelWithDebInfo</code> ran out of disk space on my machine after
    using ~120GB (binaries like clang-tidy alone were 5GB)</li>
  <li>cross-compilation is not needed, so targeting x86 alone is sufficient for my needs</li>
  <li>the install location is /usr/local/* as per default</li>
  <li><code>sudo ldconfig</code> should be run after the install to avoid wrong library complications</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Now, clang/clang++ will resolve to the locally built clang and libc++ is a compiler flag away.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here we build a small application that uses <code>std::print()</code>:
<pre>
$ cat main.cpp
#include &lt;print&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  std::print("hello print\n");
  return 0;
}
$ clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -std=c++2b main.cpp -o main
$ ./main
hello print
</pre>
</p>

<h2>CMake Support</h2>

<p>
In CMake, the default compiler is gcc/g++, so the typical way to override this
is by specifying a
<a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html">toolchain file</a>
(some extra variables set for consistency/convenience):
<pre>
$ cat x86_64-pc-linux-elf.cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR X86)
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER /usr/local/bin/clang)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /usr/local/bin/clang++)

set(cpp23flags "-fexperimental-library -stdlib=libc++")
set(debugflags "-O0 -glldb -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-inline")
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG_INIT "${cpp23flags} ${debugflags}")
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE_INIT "${cpp23flags}")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG_INIT "${cpp23flags} ${debugflags}")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE_INIT "${cpp23flags}")
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT "-lc++abi -fuse-ld=lld")
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT "-lc++abi -fuse-ld=lld")
set(CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT "-lc++abi -fuse-ld=lld")
</pre>
The toolchain can be selected either by:
<ol>
  <li>
specifying it at the commandline: <code>$ cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=x86_64-pc-linux-elf.cmake</code>
<li>Using a 
  <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html">CMakePresets.json</a> file
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Appendix: Alternate Install Prefix</h2>

<p>
An alternative approach is to install the binaries and libraries in an
alternate location, say ${HOME}/llvm-project/build/install.

This approach is often valued in monorepo and enterprise build environments as
part of a "hermetic" build system for a couple reasons:
<ol>
  <li>allows for easier switching between compiler builds (eg: to handle
    conflicting build environment dependencies)</li>
  <li>helps track the closure of build-time dependencies to aid in reproducible builds</li>
  <li>somewhat helps avoid accidentally using the wrong compiler version</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>
When installing to an alternate prefix, clang will not use the stdlib it was
built with and that needs to be specified manually.
</p>

<p>
For example, to compile a main.cpp using std::generator (not available in my
system's c++ stdlibs), we could run something like
<pre>
$ LLVM_ROOT=${HOME}/llvm-project            # replace with actual path
$ CLANG_INSTALL=${LLVM_ROOT}/build/install  # replace with actual path
$ ${LLVM_ROOT}/build/bin/clang++ \
  -nostdinc++ \
  -nostdlib++ \
  -isystem ${CLANG_INSTALL}/include/c++/v1 \
  -I ${CLANG_INSTALL}/include/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/c++/v1 \
  -L ${CLANG_INSTALL}/lib \
  -Wl,-rpath,${CLANG_INSTALL}/lib \
  -lc++ \
  -fexperimental-library \
  -std=c++2b \
  main.cpp -o main -O3 )
</pre>
These flags could also be added to a cmake toolchain file.
</p>

<p>
That said, this approach was cumbersome enough for me that I've preferred to
avoid fighting Unix conventions for now and simply install to /usr/local.
