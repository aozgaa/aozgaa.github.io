<h1>Sending Emails on Startup when Gaming</h1>

<p>
I've been playing the video game <emph>Magic the Gathering: Arena</emph> (aka MTGA) altogether too much.
My brother asked me to alert him every time I play.
One way to do this is to send an email every time I start the game.
</p>
<p>
I looked up how to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/125045/how-to-easily-send-emails-from-the-windows-task-scheduler/">send emails programmatically on Windows</a> (the platform MTGA runs on).
I found a perl program called <em>sendemail</em> that does this.
The program is hosted on
an <a href="http://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail/">official-seeming page</a> from 2009,
a <a href="http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/sendemail/">sourceforce page</a> which was last updated in 2009, and
a <a href="https://github.com/mogaal/sendemail">github page</a> last updated in 2012 which all seem to be the same program.
I picked the most recently edited of these three thinking it might have some fixes (or maybe a backdoor!).
After installing <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">strawberry perl</a> and doing a naive invocation, I was met with:
</p>
<pre>
$ perl path/to/sendEmail -f "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -u "starting mtg arena" -t "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -s "smtp.gmail.com:587" -o tls=yes -xu "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -xp 'mypassword' -m "some message"
invalid SSL_version specified at /home/daedalus/perl5/lib/perl5/IO/Socket/SSL.pm line 728.
</pre>
<p>
Huh? It looks like this issue has been encountered <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/53065/invalid-ssl-version-specified-at-usr-share-perl5-io-socket-ssl-pm-line-332">before</a>. So I tried a few things, and eventually this patch looked reasonable:
</p>
<pre>
$ git diff
diff --git a/sendEmail b/sendEmail
index 9f9392e..8a8dec2 100755

+++ b/sendEmail

     if ($conf{'tls_server'} == 1 and $conf{'tls_client'} == 1 and $opt{'tls'} =~ /^(yes|auto)$/) {

         if (SMTPchat('STARTTLS')) { quit($conf{'error'}, 1); }

         }
         printmsg("DEBUG => TLS: Using cipher: ". $SERVER->get_cipher(), 3);
</pre>
<p>
(Note, it looks like this is necessary on both Windows and Linux). Now I get:
</p>
<pre>
$ perl /path/to/sendEmail -f "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -u "starting mtg arena" -t "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -s "smtp.gmail.com:587" -o tls=yes -xu "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -xp 'mypassword' -m "some message"
Mar 15 16:16:57 daedalus-arch sendEmail[56559]: ERROR => ERROR => SMTP-AUTH: Authentication to smtp.gmail.com:587 failed.
</pre>
<p>
Putting in my actual password (you didn't think it was that bad, did you?) didn't work.
I enabled IMAP in <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop">gmail's settings</a>.
Stack Overflow stopped giving answers, so I continued searching and found <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en">Google's password help</a> where I was reminded that I have 2-Factor authentication enabled.
So I needed to make an <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords">app password</a>.
I chose a Windows password for mail because, well, that's what we're doing.
Finally, I used the app password, and now I can send an email to myself (or my brother!).
I then made a (powershell) script that sends an email then runs MTGA:
</p>
<pre>
perl /path/to/sendEmail -f "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -u "starting mtg arena" -t "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -s "smtp.gmail.com:587" -o tls=yes -xu "aozgaa AT gmail DOT com" -xp 'apppassword' -m "some message"

&"C:\Program Files (x86)\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\MTGALauncher\MTGALauncher.exe"
</pre>

<p>
Now I can go back to feeding my addiction.
