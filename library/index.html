            I find Rosenberg's suggestions really help cut through emotional barriers that prevent open communication.
            This book deserves to be read and re-read periodically (because I easily forget the ideas and slip into a "default" mode of interacting with others).
            The grammatical structure of his phrases is admittedly awkward, but I've found ways to smooth out the language while capturing the intention of his template.

            that (i) "consciousness" is an incredibly overloaded term, and Jaynes' theory makes more sense when interpreted as speaking about having a theory of one's mind rather than literally lacking the capability for reflection, (ii) the evidence for localization of voices to separate hemispheres in the brain has not been affirmed, and (iii) Jayne's argument for the degree to which having the psychotechnology of a theory of mind seems to be overstated when comparing to non-Western cultures that may have lacked theory of mind until more recently, for which a firmer historical record is available.
            Still, the general idea that different individuals have different theories of mind both about themselves and others meshes well with my own experience.

        In this way, I find many of the conclusions Caplan makes, such as the power of twin studies in demonstrating the relative unimportance or nurture, difficult pills to swallow.
        Marketing may misinform us to spend excessively on our children, but Caplan's argument seems a similar straw man.
        I have had similar reservations about other books, such as Scott Walker's "Why We Sleep" and the priming section of Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow",
        where a large body of weak evidence is more confusing than clarifying. What is the right way to update your prior in response to many bad arguments?
